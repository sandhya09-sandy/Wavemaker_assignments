        <h3 ALIGN="center"> College Entrance and Placement Tests</h3>
        <p> The process of getting accepted into a four-year school is very different than getting into a two-year community or technical college.
        </p>
        <h4 style="color:red;"> <strong>Two-Year Schools</h4>
        <p> Most two-year colleges do not require a college-entrance exam for admission if applicants have a high school diploma or GED. This is true at all Minnesota State two-year colleges. However, new students do take a placement exam to determine which levels of classes are right for them.
            Schools can use the results of a placement test to determine if a student is ready for the career-specific program they chose, or if they first need to take courses to increase their basic skills.
            If you do not have a GED or high school diploma, you still may qualify to enroll in a career pathway program by taking an "Ability to Benefit" test. Many colleges use the same test, Accuplacer, both for placement and the "Ability to Benefit" test.</strong></p>
        <h4 style="color:red;"> Four-Year Schools</h4>
        <p> <em> Most four-year colleges and universities use standardized tests as part of the admission process. These tests compare the grades and knowledge of students who graduated from different high schools or took the GED.
            The two standardized entrance exams accepted by the majority of colleges are the ACT and the SAT. Make sure you know which tests are required for admission at your college choices.
            Acceptable scores on these tests are an important part of the information four-year colleges use to determine if they will accept a student or not.</p>
